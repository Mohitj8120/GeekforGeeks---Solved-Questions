# 100 Days of Geeky Coding Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Geeky Coding Challenge repository! This challenge is an effort to improve my coding skills by solving one programming question from GeekforGeeks daily for the next 100 days.

## Motivation

The purpose of this challenge is to:

- **Consistency**: Develop a habit of coding every day to strengthen programming skills.
- **Diverse Learning**: Explore a variety of algorithmic problems on GeekforGeeks.
- **Progress Tracking**: Document daily progress to see improvement over time.

## Rules

1. **Daily Commitment**: Solve and commit at least one programming question from GeekforGeeks every day.
2. **Readme Updates**: Document each day's question, solution, and any learnings in the README file.
